# Pokedex CLI - Gopher Edition 

Code challenge from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/) backend development track, based on requirements provided by the course.

Mostly done code ahead, but checking back on the guide video later for some optimization.

The program itself is a small REPL that simulates a Pokedex on the CLI, using the popular PokeAPI. The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with the following topics in the Go Language:

- Reading Inputs
- Making HTTP Requests
- Handle JSON
- Cache data

My main goal with this: Actually do something with go, since I've been studying it for a while, but built not much.
